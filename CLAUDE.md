# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Shopify theme for the Konnected.io store, built on **Horizon** — Shopify's first-party flagship theme that uses Liquid theme blocks. There is **no build step and no test suite**: the theme is server-rendered Liquid, JavaScript ships as native ES modules, and CSS ships as-is. Development happens against a live Shopify store through the Shopify CLI.

`origin` is `konnected-io/horizon-base`. Commits titled "Update from Shopify for theme horizon-base/main" come from Shopify's GitHub integration syncing edits made in the Shopify theme editor — expect machine-generated changes to `config/settings_data.json` and template JSON. To pull upstream Horizon updates, see the `upstream` workflow in README.md (`git pull upstream main` from `https://github.com/Shopify/horizon.git`).

## Commands

```bash
shopify theme dev        # local dev server with hot reload against the connected store
shopify theme check      # lint/validate Liquid (also runs in CI on every commit)
shopify theme push       # upload local theme to the store (use --unpublished for a draft)
shopify theme pull       # download store state (settings_data.json, template edits made in editor)
```

There are no unit tests. Validation = `shopify theme check` + visual verification in the dev server / theme editor.

### Opening a pull request

This repo is a fork: `origin` is `konnected-io/horizon-base` and `upstream` is `Shopify/horizon`. Because of the `upstream` remote, a bare `gh pr create` defaults to opening the PR against **Shopify/horizon** — which is wrong. Always target this repo explicitly:

```bash
gh pr create --repo konnected-io/horizon-base --base main --head <branch> --title "..." --body "..."
```

## Architecture

### Liquid rendering model
- **Server-rendered first.** Business logic, money formatting, and translations live in Liquid, not JS. Async/on-demand rendering exists but is used sparingly as progressive enhancement.
- **Directory roles:** `sections/` (top-level page regions with `{% schema %}`), `blocks/` (composable units placed inside sections), `snippets/` (reusable Liquid partials rendered with `{% render %}`), `templates/` (JSON page definitions that wire sections+blocks together), `layout/theme.liquid` (document shell).
- **Block naming convention:** blocks prefixed with `_` (e.g. `_card.liquid`, `_cart-summary.liquid`) are private/nested — meant to be rendered by other blocks/sections, not exposed as standalone theme-editor blocks. Unprefixed blocks are user-selectable.
- **Sections accept `{"type": "@theme"}` and `{"type": "@app"}`** in their schema to allow theme blocks and app blocks. See `.cursor/rules/sections.mdc` for the required section skeleton (schema, CSS scoping via section class, translation keys for all text).

### JavaScript: web components
- JS is **progressive enhancement via custom elements**, not a framework. The base class is `Component` in [assets/component.js](assets/component.js) (extends `DeclarativeShadowElement`). It auto-wires child elements marked with a `ref` attribute into `this.refs`, supports declarative event listeners, and hydrates declarative shadow DOM.
- **Module resolution uses an import map**, not a bundler. `@theme/*` specifiers map to asset files in [snippets/scripts.liquid](snippets/scripts.liquid) (e.g. `@theme/events` → `events.js`). When adding a new shared module, register it there and add a `modulepreload` if it's critical. Import with `import { ThemeEvents } from '@theme/events'`.
- Cross-component communication goes through events defined in `assets/events.js` (`ThemeEvents`).
- Type checking is via JSDoc + `assets/global.d.ts` (declares `Shopify`, `Theme` globals). No TypeScript compilation step.

### Konnected-specific customizations
These are the local additions on top of stock Horizon — preserve them when merging upstream:
- **`assets/custom.js`, `assets/custom.css`** — site-specific JS (hash-scroll with sticky-header offset, header group height calc) and styles.
- **`assets/accordion-custom.js`, `assets/product-custom-property.js`** — bespoke components.
- **Custom templates** (named JSON templates assigned to specific products/collections/pages in the editor): `page.platforms.json`, `page.control4.json`, `page.smartthings.json`, `page.hubitat.json`, `page.homeassistant.json`, `page.konnected-partners.json`, `page.partners-index.json`, `page.collabs.json`, `collection.alarm-panel-pro-kits.json`, `collection.gdo-collection.json`, `collection.partners-and-resellers.json`, `product.gdo-blaq-v2.json`, `product.garage-door-opener.json`, `product.pro-conversion-kit.json`, `product.pro-interface-kit.json`.

## Conventions enforced by Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/`)

- **Accessibility is non-negotiable.** Per-component WAI-ARIA rules exist for accordions, tabs, headings, tooltips, comboboxes, modals, flip cards, product cards, and sale prices. When building or editing any interactive component, match the required ARIA attributes, keyboard handlers (Enter/Space/Escape/arrows), and focus management described in the relevant `.mdc` file.
- **All user-facing text must be a translation key.** Use `{{ 'group.key' | t }}`; add the key to `locales/en.default.json` (the required source of truth) under a hierarchical, snake_case path (max 3 levels deep). `*.schema.json` locale files hold theme-editor setting labels (`t:` references in schemas). See `.cursor/rules/locales.mdc`.
